# OOP_LABS
OOP Laboratory Works Overview
Welcome to my OOP Lab Repository! The repository is organized into separate branches, with each branch representing a distinct lab.

I chose Java for the OOP course - an ideal language for exploring object-oriented concepts.

Repository Structure
main branch: Serves as the base branch, containing general documentation and any shared resources.
Other branches: Each branch corresponds to a different lab exercise.

Labs List
LAB 0: oop-classification-system branch.
Introduces the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, including classes, standard libraries, and external libraries.

LAB 1: oop-intermediate-tasks branch.
Building confidence with designing classes, creating diverse objects, exploring modules and packages, and continuing mastering Git essentials.

LAB 2: oop-advanced-task
