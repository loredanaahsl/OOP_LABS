# OOP Laboratory Works Overview

Welcome to my OOP Lab Repository! The repository is organized into separate branches, with each branch representing a distinct lab.

I chose Java for the OOP course - an ideal language for exploring object-oriented concepts.

# Repository Structure

main branch: Serves as the base branch, containing general documentation and any shared resources.
Other branches: Each branch corresponds to a different lab exercise.

# Labs List

1. LAB 0: oop-intro-classification-system branch.
Introduces the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, including classes, standard libraries, and external libraries.
2. LAB 1: oop-intermediate-tasks branch.
Building confidence with designing classes, creating diverse objects, exploring modules and packages, and continuing mastering Git essentials.
3. LAB 2: oop-advanced-tasks branch. This lab focuses on using inheritance to build and extend a hierarchy of classes. You'll explore class hierarchies, method overriding, and encapsulation to create a structured system of beverage-related classes, enhancing reuse and promoting clean code principles.
